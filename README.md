# moebius-mirror
This Python script visualizes Dirichlet domains in the upper half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry. Given a base point  𝑧_0 ∈ 𝐻 and a set of Möbius transformation generators in SL(2, 𝑅), it computes the region of points closer (in the hyperbolic metric) to 𝑧_0 than to any of its images under the group.
